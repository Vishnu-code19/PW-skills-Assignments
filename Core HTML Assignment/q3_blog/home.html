    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello, I'm Vishnu, a recent graduate from the prestigious NIT Warangal.
        I've honed my skills in SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau, enabling me to
         extract valuable insights from data and solve complex problems. 
         I have a keen interest in data analysis and visualization, 
         which led me to continuously expand my knowledge and currently embark 
         on a journey into web development through PW Skills. I'm known for 
         my enthusiasm, practical approach to learning, critical thinking 
         abilities, and analytical mindset. Whether it's deciphering data patterns, 
         creating dynamic web applications, or finding innovative solutions, 
         I'm driven by the challenge of turning ideas into reality. 
         My education and experiences have equipped me with a holistic skill set, 
         and I'm excited to contribute my talents and passion to projects that 
         demand creativity and technical expertise.
    </p>
