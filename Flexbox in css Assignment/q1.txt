Q1. Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When
would you chose to use one over the other?
Ans: Flexbox is good for one-dimensional layouts, like rows or columns of items.
Grid is good for two-dimensional layouts, like tables or magazine covers.

I would choose flexbox when I need to align items in one axis like navbar.
I would choose grid over flexbox when there's a need complex 2D layouts like gallery.
