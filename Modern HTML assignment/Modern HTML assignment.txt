2. What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities.
Ans: HTML entities are special codes that represent reserved characters, symbols, or characters with specific
meanings in HTML. They are used to display characters that might otherwise be interpreted as HTML code or
cause rendering issues in web browsers. HTML entities are written using an ampersand (&) followed by a
specific code or name, and ending with a semicolon (;).

5 Commonly Used HTML Entities:
&lt; - Represents the less-than symbol <.
Example: <p>This is an example &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;.</p>
&gt; - Represents the greater-than symbol >.
Example: <p>For more information, visit our website &gt; <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
&amp; - Represents the ampersand symbol &.

3. Define accessibility in the context of web development? Discuss why it's essential to create accessible
websites and how it benefits different user groups
Ans: Accessibility in web development means creating websites in a way that makes them easy to use for people with disabilities.
It's about making sure everyone, no matter their abilities, can understand, navigate, and interact with online content.

Why is Accessible Web Design Important?

Inclusivity:
Accessible websites make sure that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use the internet for information and services.

Legal Compliance:
Some countries have laws that say websites must be accessible. This helps prevent legal problems and ensures fair access for all.

Better User Experience:
Accessible websites often make the internet easier to use for everyone. They have clear menus and content layouts.

Business Growth:
When websites are accessible, they can reach a larger audience. This means more people might visit, become loyal users, or even customers.

How Accessibility Helps Different Groups:

Visual Impairments: 
Accessibility includes things like screen reader support and descriptions for images to help blind and visually impaired users.

Hearing Impairments: 
Captions and transcripts make audio content understandable for those with hearing impairments.

Motor Disabilities: 
Making websites navigable by keyboard and having easy-to-click buttons helps people with limited physical abilities.

Cognitive Disabilities: 
Accessible design simplifies content and layout, making it easier for people with cognitive challenges to understand.

Elderly Users: 
Accessible websites take into account limitations that come with age, ensuring older users can use them effectively.

Mobile Users: 
Accessibility also improves the experience for people using websites on mobile devices. It makes the layout simpler and 
adjusts to different screen sizes.

1. Use Meaningful HTML Elements:
When you create a web page, use special HTML elements that have names that make sense, like <header> for the top part, 
<nav> for the menu, <main> for the main content, <article> for articles, and <footer> for the bottom part. 
This helps people who use assistive technologies, like screen readers, understand what each section is for, 
making it easier for them to navigate and understand the content.

2. Describe Images with Alt Text:
Whenever you add pictures to your website, don't forget to include a short and informative description using the "alt" attribute. 
This description, called alt text, is read aloud by screen readers, helping people who can't see the images understand what they are about. 
So, make sure your alt text is clear and directly related to the image.

3. Be Mindful with Colors:
Colors are important for web design, but don't rely on them alone to convey information. For example, if you use colors to show errors,
also include a clear text explanation of the error. Additionally, make sure there's enough contrast between the text and the background, 
so people with vision problems can easily read the content.
